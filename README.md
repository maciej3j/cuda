# 100 days programming CUDA 
This challenge is inspired by [Umar Jamil](https://github.com/hkproj/100-days-of-gpu/blob/main/CUDA.md).

### Progress
#### Day 1
- Implemented basic vector addition using both standard way using for loop (CPU) and GPU using CUDA.
- Tested the speed of how much time execution changed by using CUDA.
```
CPU avg time: 0.346965
GPU avg time: 0.004124
Speedup: x84.129336
```
